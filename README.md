# quran_rota_generator 

## The premise:

I am part of a class who are doing a collective Quran recital. A classmate has to drudge through each page, allocate a portion to each memeber of the class and send out an image with the rota.

I figured it might be easier to automate (at least parts of) it with a python script.

The following is the result. It is quite procedural as of now, but it gets the job done - can write to a csv file containing starting and ending points (with specified page increment) in surah:ayah format.
